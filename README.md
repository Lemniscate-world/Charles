# Lemniscate Music Lab

A hybrid music creation system combining algorithmic composition, modular synthesis, and traditional DAW workflows.

## Overview

This project integrates multiple music creation approaches:
- Algorithmic composition with TidalCycles and SuperCollider
- Modular synthesis with VCV Rack
- Traditional DAW workflows (Bitwig/Ableton)
- Visual programming and generative art

## Components

### Core Tools
- **SuperCollider** - Sound synthesis engine
- **TidalCycles** - Pattern-based live coding
- **Bitwig/Ableton** - DAW for arrangement and mixing

### Additional Tools
- VCV Rack for modular synthesis
- Python scripts for AI-based generation
- Visual tools (Hydra, TouchDesigner)

## Getting Started

1. Install SuperCollider and TidalCycles
   ```
   # Use the provided script to add GHCup to PATH
   ./add_ghcup_to_path.sh
   ```

2. Explore the AlgoStyle directory for pattern examples
